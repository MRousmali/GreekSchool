            If you want to learn Greek, taking classes in the country itself and enjoy the vibrant culture, beautiful
            beaches and impressive history of Greece while you immerse yourself in the local lifestyle is a great way to
            advance your language learning.

            You can explore the busy city and cool, alternative culture of Athens or the beautiful university town of
            Thessaloniki, visit the museums and historic sites showcasing Greece's rich history, or enjoy some of the
            stunning beaches and beautiful natural landmarks the country is known for while basking in the Mediterranean
            sun.

            Alongside learning the basics of the Greek language from local, highly trained instructors, you will fall in
            love the country's great food scene, incredible nightlife, natural beauty, and friendly people.
        </p>
        <h3>Course Types</h3>

        <h4>Universities</h4>
        <p>
            Most instruction takes place primarily in Greek Universities – and courses are taught in Greek, though there
            are some branches of American and UK universities in Athens that offer instruction in English for those who
            are at a less advanced Greek language level. Athens and Thessaloniki are home to several prestigious Greek
            universities, and studying at a local institution of higher education gives foreign students the chance to
            socialize and mingle with local Greeks, thus further improving learners' Greek conversational skills through
            immersion.

            Alternatively, you can also enroll in some of the smaller universities on the islands or in the countryside
            to enjoy a different, more laid-back pace of living.
        </p>

        <h4>Language Schools</h4>

        <p> Language schools and institutes offer a wide range of courses, and are usually better at helping students
            improve on specific areas of the language they want to learn. Always check to make sure the institution and
            teacher are both accredited. Throughout the country, including the main cities of Athens, Thessaloniki,
            Patra and the islands throughout the rest of Greece, you can find schools with a variety of class sizes,
            frequency and intensity, as well as prices; this way, you are sure to find one that fits your schedule,
            goals, and budget.
        </p>

        <h4>Private Classes</h4>

        <p> For those who prefer to learn in a private setting rather than in a classroom, private tutors can help you
            with personalized lessons tailored to your strengths and weaknesses in Greek. If you want to learn Greek but
            can't commit to the regular class schedule of a language school or university and need a more flexible
            solution, private tutors may also be the best choice for you.
        </p>
        <p>Private tutors will usually be more expensive than language school classes, but it's possible to find tutors
            that charge as little as €10 per hour, especially since wages in Greece tend to be lower than the European
            and North American average
        </p>

        <h4>Planning Your Trip</h4>
        <h4>Housing</h4>
        <p>You can find accommodation in Greece fairly easily, however it is unlikely your university or institution
            will provide housing options for you. Dormitories are not a given in most Greek universities, so you will
            most likely have to rent nearby apartments on your own; you can definitely ask about housing options, but
            still make sure to check local rentals or other housing choices.
        </p>
        <p>There are plenty of websites to help accommodate you, including To Spiti Mou, Spitogatos, and even Airbnb;
            rentals are sometimes done much more easily after you have arrived in the country. A lot of business in
            Greece operates on word of mouth, so if you make new friends and acquaintances, ask if they know of any
            apartments or houses for rent.
